 * Class Info: A very very basic implementation of the game Battleship! The user can click through
 * the tiles (in this case JButtons) and try to sink a ship, and if they do, they win! When
 * they click on a 'tile' or button, then it will be exposed whether or not a ship was there,
 * 0 being a ship was not a 1 being a ship was!
