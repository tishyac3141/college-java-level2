 * @author: Tishya Chhabra 
 * Date: September 12 2020
 * Class Info: A class that performs a simple division. It has two parameters, numerator
 * and denominator, and has a method called 'calculateDivision()'
 * it specifically throws a 'ZeroInputError' (specified in the package) if the denominator 
 * has a value of 0 which.
 * 
 * main method is included in this class which tests the code; it uses a try-catch
 * block that handles the 'calculateDivision()' method throwing an exception
 * 
 * NOTE: I wasn't sure what you meant by: "If the denominator equals 0, it will pass through 
 * the ZeroInputError."
 * hence, i wrote it so it throws the ZeroInputError if the denominator is 0, and I added
 * the main method to test the code. hopefully that is what you were expecting!
